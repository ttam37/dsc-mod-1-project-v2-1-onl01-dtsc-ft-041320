## Project Goals

The goal is to conduct data analysis to get a better understanding of the movie industry. We did exploratory data analysis on several movie datasets to explore what type of films are doing the best in the box office. We answered several questions in which we will be exploring various relationships of successful film characteristics to determine what type of movie we should create.

## The Datasets

We analyzed the following movie related data from the following sources:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

## Files in this Repo

1. EDA (Notebook)
   * We did exploratory data analysis on the datasets and the notebook contains detailed and organized code for each question. Each question will contain meaningful data visualizations with follow up explanations.
2. Powerpoint Presentation
   * The team gave a high level non-technical overview of our project by providing stakeholders with actionable insights for creating the next big film.
3. Video Walkthrough
   * I created a personal presentation by providing a better understanding of our analysis. I explained what the project entails and explored each question in detail.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The film industry is becoming more competitive and faster paced. In addition, people's taste in films will also change throughout the years based on society changes. In the 40's and 50's, people craved for movies that involved heroism and freedom. In this decade, people are craving drama and action. We focused on films that were more relevant to today's society and want the people want. Times have changed and as we strive to create a new movie in this competitive industry, we focused our efforts on films that were only released in the past decade.

### Question 1: What is the distribution for films in each genre? What are the top 3 genres?

### Question 2: What are the top 10 most popular and highest rated films? Is there a relationship between popularity and highest rated?

### Question 3: What are the top 10 movies with the highest gross profit margin? Is there a relationship between Popularity and Profit Margin?

## Conclusion



## Summary

The end of module projects and project reviews are a critical part of the program. They give you a chance to both bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects and to practice key "business judgement" and communication skills that you otherwise might not get as much practice with.

The projects are serious and important. They are not graded, but they can be passed and they can be failed. Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Finally, this is your first project. We don't expect you to remember all of the terms or to get all of the answers right. If in doubt, be honest. If you don't know something, say so. If you can't remember it, just say so. It's very unusual for someone to complete a project review without being asked a question they're unsure of, we know you might be nervous which may affect your performance. Just be as honest, precise and focused as you can be, and you'll do great!
